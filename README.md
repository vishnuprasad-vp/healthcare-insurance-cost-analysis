# 🏥 Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis  
### Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare insurance data to understand
the key factors that influence medical insurance charges.
Using Python and data visualization techniques, the project demonstrates
a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow from raw data to insights.

The analysis helps identify how age, BMI, smoking habits, and other
demographic factors impact healthcare costs.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Converted categorical values into numerical format
- Created derived features such as:
  - Smoking indicator (`is_smoker`)
  - Age groups for better analysis

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- Distribution of medical charges
- Comparison of charges between smokers and non-smokers
- Age group vs medical charges
- BMI vs medical charges
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Smoking is the strongest factor affecting medical insurance charges
- Older individuals tend to have higher medical costs
- Higher BMI is associated with increased charges
- Lifestyle factors significantly influence healthcare expenses

---

## 🌍 Societal Perspective
- Encourages awareness of healthy lifestyle choices
- Helps policymakers design preventive healthcare strategies
- Supports data-driven decisions in public health planning

---

## 💼 Business Perspective
- Assists insurance companies in risk-based pricing
- Helps identify high-cost customer segments
- Improves cost control and profitability strategies
